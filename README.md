# TokTikMode

Play Geometry Dash levels as if you were viewing a TokTik video. Or if you just want to play Geometry Dash vertically for whatever reason..

<cy>***_Note:_*** Due to technical limitations, this mod is intentionally disabled when playing levels that use Rotate/Scale triggers, including Area Rotate/Scale triggers and Keyframe triggers.</c>

<cr>*While you can enable this mod on levels that use such triggers, doing so will very likely break a level's gameplay.*</c>

TokTikMode was tested on the following devices, operating systems, and aspect ratios:
- MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) running macOS Sequoia (macOS 15.0.1) with a 16:10 aspect ratio display
- OnePlus 9 5G (6.55-inch, 2021) running OxygenOS 13 (forked from Android 13) with a 20:9 aspect ratio display
- Dell Latitude 5420 (14-inch, 2021) running Windows 10 Enterprise Build 19045 with a 16:9 aspect ratio display

However, not all devices are created the same. Therefore, TokTikMode has additional settings for you to adjust positions and scaling of TokTik UI elements to fit your device as necessary.
