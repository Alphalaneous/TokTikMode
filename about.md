# TokTikMode

Play Geometry Dash levels as if you were viewing a TokTik video. Or if you just want to play Geometry Dash vertically for whatever reason..

<cy>***_Note:_*** Due to technical limitations, this mod is intentionally disabled when playing levels that use Rotate/Scale triggers, including Area Rotate/Scale triggers and Keyframe triggers.</c>

<cr>*While you can enable this mod on levels that use such triggers, doing so will very likely break a level's gameplay.*</c>
